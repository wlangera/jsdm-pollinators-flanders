## 09:00 - 09:30 Welcome, introduction, getting started

- welcome
- introductions of everyone
- logistics and planning of the week
- overview
  - introduction
  - motivation
  - history
  - contemporary multivariate analysis
    - VGLM: vector models (multiple species)
    - JSDM
    - model based ordination
  - conclusions

## 09:30 - 10:15 Lecture: Modeling data from ecological communities


- sampling data
  - basic thinking about study design and data properties
  - sampling variation
    - where we look, when we look, how often we look, resources available, who looks ...
    --> adjust our analysis
  - preferential sampling 
    - e.g. "I sample on an elevation gradient"
      - predefined community, environment --> effects results
    - consequences
      - few observations (lots of zeroes)
      - common versus rare species
  - sample size
    - trade-off work, time, mony
  - minimize impact of sampling process
    - a priori --> sampling design
  - detection bias
  - classification error
- data properties
- models
  - traditional models do not deal with data properties appropriately
    - classic: "we adjust the model, not the data" --> data is fixed
  - process thinking
    1. sampling effect
    2. ecological effect
- uncertainty
  - *skip theory*
  - "we are not interested in the answer for this dataset, but for an answer for all datasets"
- summary
  - most data properties can be accommodated with models
  - requires consideration
  - choose the appropriate model, not the software you like
    - "if you have a hammer, every problem is a nail"
  - some properties are more difficult to accommodate
  - many issues (sparsity, sample size ...) do not show in traditional methods
  - models will be more honest to you

## 10:45 - 11:15 Discussion: properties of community data

- density data
- proportion coverage
- presence only
  - sampling effort
  - spatial bias
  - observer bias

## 11:15 - 12:00 Lecture: Generalised Linear Models for multiple species

- Outline
  - GLMs can deal with multiple data types
- Species-environment
  - GLMs align with ecological processes
  - Ecological community: group of more species living together at the same time
  - Ecological gradients
- GLM background
  - relax normality and homoscedasticity
    - variance changes with the mean
    - range of y is bounded
  - parameters need to be estimated iteratively
     - numerical optimization
- Example 1
  - Swiss birds
  - binomial model
  - c-loglog link function: use when truncated counts (e.g. you know there are more than 1 but not how much)
  - species respond different to slope, too simplistic
  - 
- Example 2
- Vector GLMs

## 13:00 - 14:00 Practical 2: Fitting GLMs   

## 14:00 - 14:45 Lecture: Finding a good multispecies GLM
