## 09:00 - 09:30 Welcome, introduction, getting started

- welcome
- introductions of everyone
- logistics and planning of the week
- overview
  - introduction
  - motivation
  - history
  - contemporary multivariate analysis
    - VGLM: vector models (multiple species)
    - JSDM
    - model based ordination
  - conclusions

## 09:30 - 10:15 Lecture: Modeling data from ecological communities


- sampling data
  - basic thinking about study design and data properties
  - sampling variation
    - where we look, when we look, how often we look, resources available, who looks ...
    --> adjust our analysis
  - preferential sampling 
    - e.g. "I sample on an elevation gradient"
      - predefined community, environment --> effects results
    - consequences
      - few observations (lots of zeroes)
      - common versus rare species
  - sample size
    - trade-off work, time, money
  - minimize impact of sampling process
    - a priori --> sampling design
  - detection bias
  - classification error
- data properties
- models
  - traditional models do not deal with data properties appropriately
    - classic: "we adjust the model, not the data" --> data is fixed
  - process thinking
    1. sampling effect
    2. ecological effect
- uncertainty
  - *skip theory*
  - "we are not interested in the answer for this dataset, but for an answer for all datasets"
- summary
  - most data properties can be accommodated with models
  - requires consideration
  - choose the appropriate model, not the software you like
    - "if you have a hammer, every problem is a nail"
  - some properties are more difficult to accommodate
  - many issues (sparsity, sample size ...) do not show in traditional methods
  - models will be more honest to you

## 10:45 - 11:15 Discussion: properties of community data

- density data
- proportion coverage
- presence only
  - sampling effort
  - spatial bias
  - observer bias

## 11:15 - 12:00 Lecture: Generalised Linear Models for multiple species

- Outline
  - GLMs can deal with multiple data types
- Species-environment
  - GLMs align with ecological processes
  - Ecological community: group of more species living together at the same time
  - Ecological gradients
- GLM background
  - relax normality and homoscedasticity
    - variance changes with the mean
    - range of y is bounded
  - parameters need to be estimated iteratively
     - numerical optimization
- Example 1: Swiss birds
  - binomial model
  - c-loglog link function: use when truncated counts (e.g. you know there are more than 1 but not how much)
  - species respond different to slope, too simplistic
  - different types of parametrisations
- Example 2: macroinvertebrate counts in USA desert
  - again no common effect
- Vector GLMs
  - Before, one GLM over all species
  - in VGLM each species gets own dispersion parameter --> slightly more flexible
  - software
    - VGAM, glmmTMB, gllvm
  - also MLE estimation --> same likelihood as GLM but now we have $\phi_j$ instead of $\phi$
  - gllvm
    - published in 2019
    - fitted in C++
  - downside is that we have now more parameters per species, need enough data per species
  - assumes independence of species --> JSDMs tomorrow
  - no random effects

## 13:00 - 14:00 Practical 2: Fitting GLMs

- see fork

## 14:00 - 14:45 Lecture: Finding a good multispecies GLM

- background
- example 1
- hypothesis testing
- example 2
- information criteria
  - don't take the best model paradigm too seriously
  - use common sense, do not blindly test all
- example 3
  - omitted variable bias
  - which model
    - simpler model
    - report multiple models
- residuals
  - assumptions
    - no outliers
    - independent observations
    - correct distribution
    - correct link function
    - correct variance function
    - no systematic departure from the model
  - multiple kinds of residuals
    - complicated
  - graphical diagnostic (see practical)
    - residuals versus fitted
    - QQ plot
      - check whether it is the right distribution
- summary

## 15:30 - 16:30 Practical 3: Comparing multispecies GLMs

- see fork

## 16:30 - 17:15 Lecture: Introduction to the gllvm R-package

- focus on ordination and species co-occurrence

|         |<sub>14:00 - 14:45</sub>| [Lecture: Accommodating spatial or temporal autocorrelation](https://github.com/BertvanderVeen/SSMA/blob/main/Tuesday/spatialGLLVM.pdf)   |        |

|         |<sub>19:30 - 20:30</sub>| Practical 7: Traits and the phylogenetic model      |Bert    |

## 09:00 - 09:45 Lecture: Multispecies mixed effects models

- mixed models
  - mixed effects model = fixed and random effects
  - when do we need a mixed effects model
    - hierarchical/nested sampling designs
    - correlated measurements
    - correlation between species
- R packages
  - gllvm
  - random effects for species or observational units/clusters
- Species specific random effects
  - specific arguments and coding for species specific REs
  - `formula` argument
  - grouping variable should have at least 5 levels to estimate a variance
- Example 1
  - shrinkage happens because you specify the random effects are normally distributed, so large values are not very likely ("shrunk to zero")
    - very large values are often just due to data deficiency so it is better that they are close to zero with large CI that overlaps with zero, than to have a very big effect
    - **gllvm** specifies the random effects relative to the average of the community, so there is shrinkage towards the mean across species with argument `betaCom`
    - "if we do not have enough information for any particular species to estimate its effect, it reverts to the average of the whole community"
- Community level random effects
  - `row.eff` argument
  - add study design in argument for nested design
- Example 2
- Diversity
  - link between alpha, beta, gamma diversity and statistics

## 09:45 - 10:45 Practical 4: Fitting mixed-effects models

- see fork
- by default everything is species specific
  - `row.eff` used for species common effects, not good practise to omit it `~1` but it is possible
    - random effects are the same for all species
    - e.g. pit fall trap effect is the same for all species --> in row effect
  - `formula` --> species specific effects

## 11:15 - 12:00 Lecture: Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs)

- outline
- background
  - importance of correlation and independence in the data
- JSDM
  - developed 10 years ago to incorporate covariation of species for better predictions
  - questions
    - how does the environment structure the community?
    - how do trait affect species responses to the environment?
    - how do co-evolutionary stuff effect?
    - do species co-occur after the environment has been considered?
- example 1
- GLLVM
  - dimension reduction
- prediction
  - how many latent variables?
    - trade-off accuracy versus computational speed
- example 2

## 13:00 - 14:00 Practical 5: Fitting JSDMs

- see fork

## 14:00 - 14:45 Lecture: Accommodating spatial or temporal autocorrelation

- it's difficult
- other types of correlations then species correlations
  - changes in type (e.g. seasonal)
  - geographical region
  - nested aspect of study
- GLLVM
  - use of correlation matrix structure `corAR1` (temporal)
  - use of kernel functions `corExp` (spatial)
- function of latitude and longitude in fixed effect vs 
  - works for interpolation, but not for extrapolation (then kernel is better)

## 15:15 - 16:15 Practical 6: Spatial or temporal JSDMs

- see fork

## 16:15 - 17:00 Lecture: Hierarchical environmental responses

-outline
- the 4th corner
  - why do species prefer certain environmental conditions?
  - trait ~ any species specific covariate
    - you often measure individuals, not species!
- example 1
- hierarchical responses
  - limitation: it assumes that species environmental responses are fully determined by the traits
  - solution: add random effect per species
    - hierarchical model per species environment response
    - if you do not do this, you get inflated type I errors
    - issue: slower calculation
- community phylogenetics
  - related species might have similar traits/might have similar responses to the environment
  - stochastic model for trait evolution
    - Brownian motion
- example 2
  - gllvm: nearest tips -> find order
- summary

## 09:00 - 09:45Lecture: Model-based ordination

- outline
- ordination
  - why do species co-occur?
  - ecological gradients
  - ordination axis = latent variable
    - an unobserved gradient
    - ordination method is some kind of latent variable model
  - already exist for long time
    - loads of resources, artefacts and use cases are well known
  - problem, no way of validating methods
    - loads of opinions on when they are bad
- model-based ordination
  - Hui et al. ([2015](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12236))
  - ordination is useful when we have too sparse data to estimate species effects
- plot
  - biplot: closer = more similar (sites), co-occurrence (species)
    - similar to correlation plot we saw in JSDM
    - ordination plot summarises way better than huge correlation plot
  - triplot: add environmental variables
  - you can rotate afterwards **GPArotation** package
    - distances do not change
- example 1
- tools
  - can also do predictions now (not possible in classical ordination)
- example 2
  - you can even plot uncertainties of predictions

## 11:15 - 12:00 Lecture: Bringing covariates into the ordination

- outline
- constrained
